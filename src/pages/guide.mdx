# Majeggstics Guide & Rule Book!

Welcome to The Majeggstics, where _No Farmer is Left Behind_!

Majeggstics is a worldwide group of Egg Inc. players with the common goal of making sure
_every_ player can complete _every_ contract, by optimizing play strategies and making
fair contributions to our co-ops.

## Minimum rules

The Majeggstics are a team — we expect everyone to contribute to our co-ops. When you
register for a contract, you are agreeing to meet the minimum contribution for that
contract.

**The minimum egg laying rate for each contract is posted in \#mj-announcements. Minimum
is measured at 12 and 24 hours after contract start.**

The 12 hour minimum is lower than the 24 hour minimum. If you meet the 12 hour minimum,
you have passed! If you don’t meet the 12 hour minimum, you still have not failed, but
you must meet the 24 hour minimum to pass.

You will receive a strike for joining your contract later than 5 hours after start, and
an additional strike if you have not joined by the 24 hour check. (Strikes may also be
given for inappropriate behavior in chat, and server staff are notified when server
rules are broken.)

Tokens are the human players who manage the Majeggstics - we recruit new members, help
people play the game more efficiently, start and add people to co-op groups, and confirm
everyone has met the minimum required laying rate for each contract.

A token will communicate with you if you receive a strike. Strikes are recorded. After
four strikes, you will be removed from Majeggstics. Strikes are only counted for the
last 20 contracts you complete - after that, strikes are erased.

After a strike, a token will create a **private thread** in \#the_majeggstics to talk
to you about what happened, and make sure you are supported to be successful in the
future. If you’re concerned you won’t be successful, you can send `mj-support`
anywhere in Majeggstics channels and a support Token will help you out. It can take time
to respond, so ask for help using `mj-support` early on!

Remember that the Majeggstic’s goal is to see everyone succeed. Minimums are meant to
help you, not hurt. If you’re struggling to meet minimum or need help with a contract,
ask for advice in \#the_majeggstics or your grade’s Majeggstics channel. The group would
be thrilled to help, and everyone will have the chance to learn along with you!

#### Registering for a Contract

**Contracts are released 3 times a week at:**

year.

![New Contract Icon](/images/newContractIcon.jpg)

- Monday has a new contract for everyone. The first Monday of each month has a new
  Prophecy Egg (PE) contract.
- Wednesday and Friday have leggacy contracts. Wednesday has a non-PE contract, and
  Friday has a PE contract.
- If you want to be pinged when contracts are released, go to #optional-roles and select
  the “Contracts” role.

When a new contract is released, Wonky, our beloved bot, will generate a registration
post in \#mj-announcements. Select a time slot — we start contracts at +1, +6, and +12
hours after the contract release. Register for the time slot that's most convenient for
your schedule. You must join your co-op and start your farm within 5 hours of your start
time. It is your responsibility to register early and join your co-op.

Registration for each time slot is finalized when Wonky creates co-ops. We recommend you
sign up at least 15 minutes early, as co-ops may be created up to 5 minutes early
because of the size of our group. If co-ops are late, be patient with initiators.

Late registrations may be accepted depending on initiator availability and available
spaces in our co-ops. If you are unable to register for a contract with Majeggstics, you
can join a public co-op in the "Co-Op Recruitment" section and join us for the
next contract!

## Joining your Co-op

Ping! Pong! Wonky generated your co-op and started a thread in your grade’s channel.
Check your DMs from Wonky for the contract code. If you’re the first person,
double-check your contract code, then start the co-op immediately. Do not wait in the
lobby.

- Our co-ops are set to **private** to ensure that everyone participating meets our
  expectations. Do not share your co-op code or set the co-op to public — this can
  result in Majeggstics getting kicked from our co-ops and makes extra work for tokens.

  - The toggle needs to stay to the left for the co-op to remain private.

- Notify an available token immediately if there is an error with your registration
  (e.g. wrong grade, registered in multiple co-ops) or if you registered and teams have
  been made but you were not assigned to a co-op.

  - There is currently a known bug when joining co-ops - you appear joined on your
    device, but not on the Egg Inc servers. Please confirm your game is in sync with the
    server by checking the eicoop link in your co-op thread _before boosting_.

- Wonky groups members together to ensure we have balanced teams. You must join the
  co-op you are assigned to. If you:

  - Join your co-op later than 5 hours after start, you will receive one strike.
  - Do not join your co-op before the 24-hour check, you will receive two strikes.
  - Join a Majeggstics co-op without being assigned by Wonky or a token, you will be
    removed from Majeggstics.

- Tokens monitor many co-op threads and can&apos;t respond to every message. If you need
  help, make sure to ask in #the_majeggstics or your grade&apos;s Majeggstic channel to
  make sure an available token sees your message. Don&apos;t be afraid to interrupt
  off-topic chat — our priority is helping your co-op complete successfully.

## Start and grow your contract farm

- Finish common research, buy habs, and buy transport.

  - Use artifacts that increase income like Demeter&apos;s Necklace, Tungsten Ankh, Book
    of Basan; and artifacts that hold Shell Stones, Soul Stones, and Prophecy Stones.
  - Puzzle cubes will lower research costs - use your income-boosting artifacts, then
    switch your puzzle cube on while you’re buying. If you need to save more, swap the
    cube out for a better income artifact.

- Equip your best **Ship in a Bottle (SIAB)** to help your co-op mates earn more money.
  Your SIAB is worth more to the team than any artifact you can equip for yourself.
  Tachyon deflectors are not useful until after teammates have boosted, so equip an extra
  artifact for yourself until then.

- **Soul Mirror** a higher EB player if you can’t finish your common research or buy
  large enough habs/transport for your intended boosts.
  - The person in your contract with the highest EB will have a soul mirror icon next to
    their name in your Discord thread.
  - Majeggstics is privileged to have many high EB players with good availability who
    can help you maximize your earnings, but they are not required to do anything beyond
    following regular Majeggstics rules for playing the contract.
  - Use Bird Feed and Yon Calculator to maximize your earnings, no matter your mirror’s
    EB.
- Send **Chicken Boxes** every 3 hours to help your co-op mates grow their farms.
- Request or send **tokens** to other co-op members upon request.
  - Sending tokens to another player lowers their contract teamwork score — be
    thoughtful when sending tokens, and do not spam send individual tokens. Consider if
    your teammate has already boosted and how many tokens an AFK player will return to
    before you send tokens.
  - Spamming individual tokens or token dumping is not allowed.

			to help determine the best boost combination for your goals - these will vary widely depending
			on the contract, number of players in your group, your EB, and artifacts.
			<ul>
				<li>
					Most players can use a <b>Legendary Tachyon Prism & Epic Boost Beacon</b> to completely
					fill habs.{' '}
				</li>
				<li>
					Players with Tier 4 Artifacts can often use <b>two Epic Tachyon Prisms</b> (together or
					separately) to fill habs over 50%.{' '}
				</li>
				<li>
					Advanced artifact players with powerful dilithium and life sets can often hablock with a
					single Epic Tachyon and a few chicken runs post-boost. A powerful tachyon artifact set can
					result in shipping locking.{' '}
				</li>
				<li>
					Consider the number of people in your contract and the impact deflectors will have on your
					laying rate - choose more GE efficient boosts in larger co-ops.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			Before boosting, equip artifacts with <b>dilithium stones</b> to increase your boost time.
		</li>
		<li>
			Immediately after starting your boosts, switch to your{' '}
			<b>best monocle, chalice, and artifacts with life stones</b>. Leave the farm to take advantage
			of the Internal Hatchery Calm Epic Research. If needed, equip a <b>gusset</b> to increase hab
			space.
		</li>
	</ul>
</section>
<section>
	<h4>Post-boosting</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<b>Tachyon Deflectors</b> boost your co-op mates&apos; laying rates - since Majeggstics aim
			for equal contributions, a deflector will benefit your co-op overall more than any artifact
			that only works on your individual farm.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Metronome</b> and artifacts with <b>tachyon stones</b> boost egg laying rate.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Compass</b> and artifacts with <b>quantum stones</b> increase shipping rate.
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Check in regularly</b> and don’t let your chickens fall asleep!
			<ul>
				<li>
					The game does not update automatically. You must open your co-op farm and sync with the
					server for us to see your earnings before minimums are checked. Please check-in 15 minutes
					before your minimum check and confirm your lay rate using the eicoop link in your thread
					to avoid getting a strike.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Contact a token:</b>
			<ul>
				<li>If you see glitching in your group. Glitching is not allowed in Majeggstics co-ops.</li>
				<li>
					Enforcing minimum is the responsibility of tokens. Do not ping low performing members
					yourself, allow tokens to contact them and offer support.
				</li>
				<li>
					Removing members from our contracts is not allowed. If you remove Majeggstics players from
					our co-op without specific instructions from a token, you will be removed from
					Majeggstics.
