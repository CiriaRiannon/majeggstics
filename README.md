This project needs at least [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) version 18+ to run. I use the current LTS (Long-term support) version 20.10.0 and anyone who is installing Node.js for the first time should preferably do the same.

Once you clone the project, go to the root folder of the project in the terminal of your choice, then run `npm install` and then `npm run dev` to run the project. You'll need to run `npm install` just once.
